# Development Podcasts - WIP
Coding podcasts I've found useful (and enjoyable) in the first few years of working as a dev - going to add some descriptions, links, and starter episode suggestions next

## Coding / dev topics

#### General dev / CS
- Base.cs Podcast
- System Design
- Ladybug Podcast
- Compiler
- Dev Discuss
- The Changelog

#### Geared toward human components of dev work + career journey
- Developer Tea
- Soft Skills Engineering
- CodeNewbie 

#### Especially relevant for Rails/Ruby devs but often broad enough for folks working with any stack
- Ruby for All (also good for early career devs)
- The Ruby on Rails Podcast
- Code with Jason
- The Bike Shed

## Coding adjacent:
- Rework
- Product Thinking
- The Design Systems Podcast

## Not coding adjacent but a good listen:
- Hidden Brain
- The Moth
